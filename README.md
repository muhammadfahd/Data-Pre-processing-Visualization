# Data Pre-Processing & Visualization for Machine Learning  
![alt text](<../unnamed (1).jpg>)

### Live Workshop Resources — by M Fahad Bashir

This repository contains learning resources from a **live hands-on workshop** focused on **Data Pre-Processing and Visualization**, two critical steps performed before applying Machine Learning algorithms.  
The session combined **conceptual understanding, practical implementation, and interactive Q&A** to help students work with real-world data confidently.

---

## 🎯 Workshop Overview
In this workshop, we explored how **raw, unclean data** is transformed into **clean, meaningful data** using preprocessing techniques and visualization.  
Participants learned *why* these steps are necessary, *how* to apply them, and *when* to make the right preprocessing decisions.

**Delivered LIVE on Zoom:** 14 December 2025  
**Audience:** University students & beginners in Machine Learning
